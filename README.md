# Granularity-guided-deep-learning-for-precise-Cryptosporidium-parasite-image-analysis




## Overview
 We propose a coarse-to-fine segmentation approach to precisely segment a population of Cryptosporidium parvum parasites from a microscopic image by the first step. Then, a subsequent classifier with high discriminatory power is used to distinguish the life stages of the parasites among 4 asexual stages: oocyst, trophozoite, meront, and free form. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address Cryptosporidium parvum analysis from microscopic images and offers a precision tool for assisting the biologists.
